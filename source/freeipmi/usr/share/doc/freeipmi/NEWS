-------------------------

Tools - New Features
--------------------
o Support new tool ipmi-config.  Ipmi-config is a consolidated
  configuration tool implementing everything that was previously in
  bmc-config, ipmi-pef-config, ipmi-sensors-config, and
  ipmi-chassis-config.
  - The consolidated tool will allow users to checkout, commit, and
    diff sections/fields across the four former tools using only one
    tool.
  - The consolidated tool will also allow users to checkout, commit,
    and diff new sections/fields not yet covered in the four former
    tools.
  - Legacy scripts for bmc-config, ipmi-pef-config,
    ipmi-sensors-config, and ipmi-chassis-config will point to the new
    tool with all appropriate options to ensure full backwards
    compatability.
  - The ipmi-pef-config --info option has been made legacy.  It is
    still supported but no longer advertised.
o Support Intel Data Center Host Interface / Management Engine as
  optional driver type for in-band communication.
  - Typically these are loaded as /dev/dcmi and /dev/mei drivers.
  - This driver is identified as the "inteldcmi" type, as it is
    specific to Intel systems.
o Support OEM extensions for Intel Windmill, Wiwynn Windmill, and
  Quanta Winterfell motherboards in ipmi-sel and ipmi-sensors.  These
  motherboards are also know as motherboards for the Open Compute
  Project (OCP).
o Support DCMI configuration in ipmi-config.
o Update FreeIPMI for changes in IPMI 2.0 Errata 5.  Include are:
  - New sensor events for Power Supply and OS Boot sensors.  New
    events are supported in all areas, ipmi-sensors, ipmi-sel,
    libipmimonitoring, etc.
  - PEF now supports 255 filter numbers, not 127.  This is supported
    in ipmi-config (formerly ipmi-pef-config).
  - Support get/set of new System Info Parameters Present OS Version,
    BMC URL, and Base OS/Hypervisor URL.  This is supported in
    bmc-info and bmc-device.
o Update ipmi-oem Intel Node Manager OEM commands for changes listed
  in Intelligent Power Node Manager 2.0 specification.
  - Due to changes in the specification, minor text changes may exist
    in some output from intelnm OEM commands.
o Update ipmi-sel to support new SEL events in Intelligent Power Node
  Manager 2.0 specification.
o Support 'serialalertsdeferred' workaround in ipmiconsole.

  order.
  - May affect scripts parsing and using the GUID.
o Bmc-info now supports --get-system-guid and outputs the System GUID
  as well as the Device GUID by default.
  - The Device GUID is not prefixed with the text "Device GUID"
    instead of just "GUID".  Any scripts scripting against this will
    need to be adjusted.
o Bmc-info now supports a workaround of 'guidformat' to read the GUID
  with a format a number of vendors have incorrectly used.
o In ipmi-config's sensor configuration, decimal values that cannot be
  encoded accurately now report a clearer error message.

o Support FreeIPMI configuration file for most tools (bmc-config,
  bmc-info, bmc-device, bmc-watchdog, ipmi-chassis,
  ipmi-chassis-config, ipmi-fru, ipmi-oem, ipmi-raw, ipmi-sel,
  ipmi-sensors, ipmi-sensors-config, ipmiconsole, ipmimonitoring,
  ipmipower, pef-config) to avoid typing common options on the command
  line.  See freeipmi.conf(5) for more information.
o Add hostrange support to all config tools (bmc-config, pef-config,
  ipmi-sensors-config, ipmi-chassis-config) to support parallel
  configuration on a cluster.
o Support --bridge-sensors in ipmi-sensors and ipmimonitoring to 
  access non-BMC owned sensors (experimental).
o Support --sensor-config-file on ipmimonitoring to support 
  alternate interpretation rules.
o Add additional "connection timeout" error message to tools to
  differentiate between no IPMI communication at all vs. session
  timeout in the middle of a command's operations.
o Support hysteresis and sensor event configuration in
  ipmi-sensors-config.
o Support additional sensor monitoring interpretations in ipmimonitoring.
o Output additional sensor information in ipmi-sensors under verbose

o Support --sdr-cache-recreate in all SDR related tools for easier
  scripting.
o Support --guid option in bmc-info to retrieve global ID (guid).
o Support "SUNBMC" in-band driver for Solaris (experimental).  Please
see README.sunbmc for compilation instructions.

Tools - Enhancements/Changes/Bug Fixes
--------------------------------------
o Global in most tools
  - Rename --no-probing option to --disable-auto-probe for consistency
    in FreeIPMI.  Backwards compatability maintained.
o Global in config tools (bmc-config, pef-config, ipmi-sensors-config)
  - More carefully check for fatal vs. non-fatal errors when
    performing configuration.  This change may result in slight
    behavior differences.  For example, a session-timeout may have
    previously been considered a non-fatal error, making the config
    tools continue on attempting more configuration activities.  Now,
    it would error out on the first session-timeout indication.
o ipmi-sensors
  - Check variety of corner cases such as whether sensor readings,
    hysteresis, thresholds, etc. are even available before reading
    them.  Some sensors may output slightly different information than
    before.  For example, suppose a power supply sensor exists for a
    power supply that is not installed.  If the sensor is enabled on
    the motherboard, ipmi-sensors would likely report "OK".  If the
    sensor is disabled on the motherboard, ipmi-sensors would now likely
    report "NA".  Previously, "OK" would have been reported under both
    conditions.
  - Output "NA" for sensors whose slave addresses are not the BMC.
  - Output "Unknown" for sensors whose readings cannot be determined.
  - Output multiple sensor status messages on separate lines, rather
    than all on one line under verbose modes.
  - Output "Unrecognized State" if the sensor specifies a state that is
    unrecognized.
  - Busy sensors are now output with "Unknown" instead of causing
    errors.
  - When fields are not relevant, do not output as much information in
    verbose and very verbose mode.  For example, don't output
    hysteresis or threshold information for power supply sensors.
  - Alter some output ordering for consistency to IPMI spec.
  - Shorten/adjust some state strings for readability under
    non-verbose output.  For example, "Fully Redundant (formerly
    "Redundancy Regained")" is now just "Fully Redundant".
  - Change default privilege from user to operator.
o ipmimonitoring
  - Support -v verbose option to output sensors readings that aren't
    readable.
  - Check corner case for sensor readability.  May lead to slightly
    different output in ipmimonitoring.  For example, suppose a power
    supply sensor exists for a power supply that is not installed.  If
    the sensor is enabled on the motherboard, ipmimonitoring would
    normally report "Nominal".  If the sensor is disabled on the motherboard, 
    ipmimonitoring would normally not output a sensor state (it would
    output "N/A" under verbose mode). Previously, "Nominal" would have
    been reported under both conditions.
  - Consider sensors without BMC slave addresses unreadable.  May
    result in sensors not being output like before.
  - Busy sensors may result in sensors not being output rather than
    causing errors.
  - Output "Unrecognized State" if the sensor specifies a state that is
    unrecognized.
  - Output multiple bitmask strings if multiple bits are set.
  - Output "OK", similarly to ipmi-sensors when no bitmask strings are
    returned from a sensor reading.
  - Shorten/adjust some state strings for readability.  For example,
    "Fully Redundant (formerly "Redundancy Regained")" is now just
    "Fully Redundant".
  - Change default privilege from user to operator.
o ipmipower
  - Removed many early experimental features from ipmipower so
    ipmipower is more like other tools.  Removed ipmi-version,
    cipher-suite-id, privilege-level, and authentication-type auto
    discovery. Removed ability to enable/disable a number of experimental
    features.
  - Changed --config to --config-file in ipmipower for consistency to
    other tools.  Backwards compatability maintiained.
  - Replace --ipmi-version option with --driver-type.  Backwards
    compatability maintained.
  - Removed hostname config file option.  Require users to always input
    atleast hostname.
  - Changed primary config file to /etc/freeipmi.conf.  Legacy config
    file searched for and still supported.
  - Prefixed config file options with 'ipmipower' for consistency to
    new global FreeIPMI config file.  Old options still supported.
o bmc-config
  - Support configuration of UserN:Lan_Session_Limit and
    UserN:Serial_Session_Limit (where N is a user id number).
  - By default, do not output unsupported authentication type enables
    when checking out the Lan_Conf_Auth section.  Output unsupported
    authentication type enables under verbose output.
  - By default, do not output serial configuration parameters on checkout.
    Output serial configuration under verbose output.
  - Remove checkout of "Misc" section and "Power_Restore_Policy"
    field, which is now handled by ipmi-chassis-config.  Backwards
    compatability commit and diff maintained.
  - Remove case sensitivity when checking a number of fields.
o ipmi-chassis
  - Alter ipmi-chassis output to print "unknown" when field is not known.
  - Alter some ipmi-chassis output text to be more consistent to IPMI
    spec.
  - Hide configuration options now supported in ipmi-chassis-config.  
o ipmi-fru
  - Output FRU device names along with IDs in ipmi-fru.
  - Reduce excessive newline outputs in ipmi-fru.
  - Output more information by default.  Change the output of verbose
    vs. very verbose output.
o ipmi-sel
  - Change default privilege from user to operator.
  - Search of SDR records by sensor number and sensor owner id.
  - Support SEL Event Record debug dumping.
o ipmiconsole
  - Support --session-timeout and --retransmission-timeout options.
  - Removed -C short option for consistency to other tools.
  - Removed hostname config file option.  Require users to always input
    atleast hostname.
  - Changed primary config file to /etc/freeipmi.conf.  Legacy config
    file searched for and still supported.
  - Prefixed config file options with 'ipmiconsole' for consistency to
    new global FreeIPMI config file.  Old options still supported.
o bmc-watchdog
  - Remove legacy 'v' option for version.
